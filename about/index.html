    <p>My name is David Kissane. I work out of two different locations. I work out of my Harmsden Counselling private practice at the Orwellness Centre. I also volunteer as a counsellor at the low cost Village Counselling Service in Tallaght.</p>

    <p>I am a pre accredited member of the Irish Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (IACP). I trained at the Institute of Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy (IICP) in Killinarden in Tallaght. Here I received my Professional Diploma in Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy.</p>
